# Simple bike shop rental app, created using Python

Currently, the app is only a script. However, there are plans to expand this into a full stack app, using Flask.
Features in the pipeline:

# Rent a bike 
# Book a future rental 
# Manage their rental 
# Store all rentals in a database 
# View past rentals

All of these functionalities will be able to be initiated by interacting with a UI.
